	Introduction and Assumptions
	<Tex id="st-0">The development of civilization relies on a stable and predictable environment. 
		For example, Earth. Earth is predictable in its sun rise, and the four seasons that it has over the year. 
		Yet on this planet light years away, civilizations grow into prosperity. 
		This civilization has yet to develop any laws based on observation of the environment that surrounds them. 
		We aim to help this civilization develop physical laws about the environment to progress society.</Tex>
	<br/>
	<Part id='asmpt-0'>There are some basic assumptions for the environment:</Part>
	<br/>
	<Tex id='asmpt-1'>1. This civilization is similar to human civilization which requires the basic needs of life such as water, sunlight, oxygen, etc.</Tex>
	<Tex id='asmpt-2'>2. In their galaxy system, the sun exists and is nowhere near the time to expand to a “red giant”. </Tex>
	<Tex id='asmpt-4'>3. The planet of the civilization does not necessarly evolove around the sun</Tex>

	<Tex id="text"> The sun provides energy to the environment allowing for the growth of food and aiding in other basic needs. By
		applying physics to predicte the roataion of a 1 body rotating around another is deifnde by orbit formula, r = (h2/μ)/(1 + e cos θ)[put in latex]. 
		if we can measure its gravity and relative mass, we can define an orbit path for the planet. </Tex>

	<Tex id='st-4-text'>In fact, on this planet, the sun has orbited in this fashion for eons. 
		It was just like any other day as civilizations woke up to a new day, except this time when the sun did not rise. 
		It was just darkness and almost everything froze while the temperature decreased. 
		The last glimpse into the sky is a flying silver disk.  </Tex>

	<Part id="st-5">This is part 5</Part>
	<Tex id='st-5-text'>Similar to the solar system, many other planets in the system influence the rotation of the sun.</Tex>

	<Part id="st-8">This is part 8</Part>
	<Tex id="st-8-text">With the help of this model, civilization now has a unique calendar that they follow. 
		When the sun is far away from the planet, they seek shelter underground to stay away from the cold. 
		The next day is predicted to be a sunny day, as the sun should rise on the horizon as any other day has. But, structures, buildings, 
		and even living organisms in the civilization are floating, with rapid increase of temperature and weightlessness around, 
		they looked up in the sky to see three gas giants rising above them.</Tex>
